This visual argument is meant to show the issue of the pollution of the ocean with plastics. This issue kills many species of fish and other sea animals yearly.
I did so by showing a plate of fish that one would eat and had the same plate but the fish are plastic. The goal is to show the viewer that we are hurting the ocean and losing fish.
The colors are similar throughout and that was to have simialrity and have it look nice while gettig the point across.
