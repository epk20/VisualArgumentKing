The goal of the argument is to show how if we keep using plastic the way we have we will kill off all the sea life. I treid to show that through the loss of the real fish that you could eat on the plate. It is meant to show how plstic will take over the ocean and we will not have fish left. This caption also tries to show that idea in explaing it a little. UNder both plates I have two call to actions to try to show that there is things we can do to help. I used 3 layers of text two layers for the two plates and one final layer for the background. I also used the scissors to cut out all the pieces of the pictures that I needed so they could sit next to each other. I had a normal plat and then palstic filled fish to try and cath the eye and divert from what you expected to see in the first half of the image. The colors of text were all picked to match the other colors in the picure such as the plate of blue on plastic. The background is meant to match and makew the words and images clear. I also used smudge to hopefully make the edge of the plate and background smoother. As well I used transparency on the fish and the backgorunds of the plates so the plastic and background could show up. I tried to use balance and have things around the middle of the image. I also did not want it to be too busy so I only added two images to the poster and only have a few colors. These helped the argument by allowing people to tell the two imagems are being comapred. As well it brings your attetnion the the plates firts as the break in the expedcted pattern of fish on a plate is broken. this casues the audience to think about what that is saying about fish and palstic. Then with minimal text you can read what it is telling you and see ways to help the issue.
